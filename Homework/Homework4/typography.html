    <h1>Programming</h1>
    
    <h3>What is programming</h3>
    <p>Programming refers to a technological process for telling a computer which tasks to perform in order to solve problems. <br>You can think of programming as a collaboration between humans and computers, in which humans create instructions for a computer to follow (code) in a language computers can understand. </p>
    <p>Programming enables so many things in our lives. Here are some examples: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you browse a website to find information, contact a service provider, or make a purchase,<br> programming allows you to interact with the siteâ€™s on-page elements, such as sign-up or purchase buttons, contact forms, and drop-down menus.</li> <br>
        <li>The programming behind a mobile app can make it possible for you to order food, book a rideshare service, track your fitness, access media, and more with ease. </li> <br>
        <li>Programming helps businesses operate more efficiently through different software for file storage and automation and video conferencing tools to connect people globally, among other things. </li>
    </ul>
